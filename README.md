Tiago Robot simulation using ROS, Rviz and Gazebo.
================================


Introduction
------------

>The purpose of this assignment is to develop a software architecture that uses opensource 3D object detection models to allow a robot manipulator to independently estimate the position of a given object (through an RGB-D camera) and potentially grasp it.
